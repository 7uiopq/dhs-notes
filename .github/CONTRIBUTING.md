# :wave: Welcome, contributors! 

:tada: Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to this repository. Or perhaps, you're viewing this file because you're exploring the innards of this repository? Well, regardless of whether you want to contribute or you're simply taking a tour here, this markdown document serves to provide information about contributing.

## First and foremost...

- Please be mindful of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) while interacting or contributing. The Code of Conduct is strictly enforced, and any violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported by emailing help@dhs-notes.study.

## Reporting a Bug

When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Refer to [the issue template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for a brief idea of the format of your bug report. Detailed information helps us to identify and resolve the bug quickly.

When submitting a bug report, please ensure that you have:
- written a **clear and descriptive title** that helps to briefly identify the problem.
- stated the **expected behaviour** of the website.
- stated how the bug has **affected and changed the curreny behaviour** of the website.
- clearly **listed the steps that you took** to reproduce the problem. When listing steps to reproduce the bug, instead of simply stating the procedures taken, make sure to also explain why you took those procedures in the first place. Not only does this provide sufficient context to the bug report in order for us to diagnose the problem, but also helps us to identify and resolve accessibility issues, if any.
- given a **thorough description of your environment.** Include your browser name and version (e.g. Google Chrome v90.0.4430.212), your operating system and whether you are on mobile or desktop (e.g. macOS 11 - Desktop, iOS 14 - Mobile). The environment of which you are in helps to identify the urgency of the bug report, and how we are able to fix the bug.
- provided **screenshots and pictures if applicable.** Bug reports can be long-winded and unclear through text reports. A screenshot helps to provide a better visualisation as to how the bug looks like.

## Creating a Pull Request

Make sure to fork this repository (click the "fork" button at the top right corner) in order to make changes. Refer to [the pull request template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to be briefly associated as to what a pull request should consist of.

When creating and submitting a pull request, make sure that you have:
- provided **a detailed description of the pull request.** Information about your pull request helps to inform others about the contents of your pull request.
- linked **the relevant issue or project.** This helps us to get a sense of what your pull request is trying to solve, and whether your pull request has solved the problem efficiently.
- stated **the motivation and context**. The motivation and context should explain why the change is needed, and what problem it solves. 
- describe **the testing process of your pull request.** Include a thorough description as to how you have tested your changes, as well as the testing environment that you have used (browser name, browser version, OS, mobile/desktop).
