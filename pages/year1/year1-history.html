                <p>It's 10pm, a day before your major exam. Stationery, check. Conducive and quiet environment, check. Focus, check. Notes, che... wait a minute, where's that set of chemistry notes that you had meticulously prepared about? You frantically search your room, leaving no pillow unturned. Before you know it, half an hour has passed, and you still can't find your notes.</p>
                <p>Frazzled with exhausation, you boot up your trusty computer and try to search online for notes. Hm, what's this? You can't find any? Even after 30 minutes fo incessant scrolling?</p>
                <p>Welp, at this point, you've wasted an hour without any productivity. It's likely that you'll only get some minimal hours of sleep with no preparation at all.</p>
