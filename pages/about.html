                            <p>It's 10pm, a day before your major exam. Stationery, check. Conducive environment, check. Focus, check. Notes, check. But wait, where's that booklet of science notes that you had meticulously prepared about cells? You frantically search your room, leaving no pillow unturned. Before you know it, half an hour has passed, and you still can't find your notes.</p>
                            <p>Frazzled with exhaustion, you boot up your trusty computer and try to search online for DHS notes. Hm, what's this? You can't find any? Even after 30 minutes of incessant scrolling?</p>
                            <p>Welp, at this point, you've wasted an hour without any productivity.</p>

                            <p>Does the above scenario seem familiar to you? Do you possess uncanny amounts of procrastination and untidiness that you're ashamed of because I'm calling you out for it right now? Have no fear, because that's exactly what this website serves to overcome!</p>
                            <p>Gone are the days of flipping through hundreds of worksheets that your teachers assigned you in order to just grab one page of notes! Gone are the days of wasting hours upon hours organising your notes and developing massive headaches!</p>
