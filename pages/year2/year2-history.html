                <p><strong><u>JO: British Surrender</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>When the British surrendered to the Japanese in 1942, the myth of "White Man Superiority" was shattered forever, which eventually led to self-governance</li>
                    <li>The ‘white man’s’ superiority was the idea that the white men such as the British, were superior to other races. Many people believed that Singapore was safe as it was well protected by the British. These beliefs were dispelled when the British surrendered to Japanese. Locals no longer felt that they could trust the British to protect them. They questioned the British’s rights to rule Singapore and had nationalistic feelings that Singapore should be taken ownership of by its own people.</li>
                    <li>For example, many British and Europeans abandoned Singapore by leaving when the Japanese were sweeping down Malaya. When they departed Singapore, there were screening facilities set up at the harbour to keep the locals, natives and military personnels from boarding the ships. Following the British surrender, the Japanese interned the British. The people saw the Japanese humiliate the British officers when they were made to do menial tasks to restore Singapore after the surrender. </li>
                    <li>When the British abandoned the people in Singapore, it clearly showed their lack of regard and concern for what was going to happen to the people. They only cared for their own safety by fleeing in advance, fearing that the Japanese would invade Singapore. Therefore, the people felt that the British had no rights to rule Singapore as they abandoned instead of protecting the people. The pitiful sights of the British doing menial tasks showed the people that the British were not superior in any way to us. Hence, they should not be given the right to rule Singapore just because they were white. Hence, this event changed people’s mindsets of British rule and led to locals to work and aspire for self-governance.</li>

                <br>
                <p><strong><u>JO: Sook Ching Massacre</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The Sook Ching Massacre provided a common experience that bonded the locals together, leading to their fight for self-governance.</li>
                    <li>The Japanese carried out the Sook Ching Occupation that was aimed at removing anti-Japanese elements in Singapore. It was targeted at the Chinese. Those who were identified as “anti-Japanese” elements were taken to remote areas to be executed. However, the identification process was random and without much basis. The atrocities continued even after the designated 3-day operation and it was estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 were massacred. In this period of time, many people lived in fear and for some, grief due to the loss of their loved ones. The extreme physical suffering the people had to go through stirred up even more resentment for the British who abandoned the people.</li>
                    <li>For example, all Chinese men aged 18 to 50 had to report to mass screening centres, such as the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) building at Stamford Road, to be examined. (The Straits-born Chinese were also made to report to mass screening centres as the Japanese made no distinction between Straits-born Chinese and the Chinese immigrants. ) Those who were identified as anti-Japanese were taken in lorries to Changi and other beaches on the east coast. </li>
                    <li>The mass killings and tortures suffered by the locals were brutal and merciless. The intense sufferings they went through during the Japanese Occupation made the locals more than ever determined not to be subjected to the self-interested rule of another external power. This resolve translated into a strong nationalist feeling to fight for self-independence.</li>

                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>One social impact of the Japanese Occupation is the locals being influenced by Japanese education and culture.</li>
                    <li>To inculcate the Japanese spirit in the people, Japanese language, culture and ideologies were taught in local schools. Incentives were given to encourage the mastery of the language. Many learnt the language as being conversant aided them in earning a living. To remove Western influence, the Japanese promoted the Japanese spirit known as Nippon Seishin.</li>
                    <li>For example, every school, government building and Japanese company began with a morning assembly. Those present at such gatherings had to stand facing the direction of Japan and sing the Japanese national anthem known as Kimigayo. Taisho or mass drills were made compulsory for students, teachers, staff of companies and government servants. Teachers had to learn Japanese several times a week. The students received their daily Japanese lessons on the school’s broadcasting service.</li>
                    <li>Nipponisation was a radical way to paint the Japanese in a positive light, which discouraged negative feelings amongst the locals towards the Japanese in order to make it easier for the Japanese to win the locals’ trust to successfully control them, thus slowing down the rise of nationalistic feelings among the locals.</li>

                <p><strong><u>JO: Propaganda</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>One social impact of the Japanese Occupation is propaganda.</li>
                    <li>Japanese propaganda was a means to influence the minds of people to get the local people to look upon Japanese rule favourably. Besides promoting Japanese culture, the Japanese also introduced policies that aimed to win the support of different communities. The Japanese controlled the media such as the radio, newspapers and the cinemas and used these to propagate Japanese teachings and military might. Radio stations were controlled by the Japanese and the people could only listen to local broadcasts. In the cinemas, only Japanese movies and propaganda films were shown.</li>
                    <li>For example, before the actual movie, they had a sort of propaganda film, ‘Asia for Asians’. And then they showed newsreels of Japanese military forces in action. All this while, the Japanese would show that they were winning everywhere. For certain parts, they would show the friendliness between the military and the civilians. After the propaganda film, they would show you the main picture. </li>
                    <li>Hence, propaganda was widely used by the Japanese during the Japanese Occupation to gain false trust and support from the locals, hence slowing down the rise of nationalistic feelings among the locals.</li>

                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Shortages of food were an economic impact of the Japanese Occupation.</li>
                    <li>The war had disrupted Singapore’s entrepot trade, which limited the import of goods into Singapore from overseas. Furthermore, most of the available resources were channelled to support Japan’s war efforts rather than to the people. People were encouraged to grow their own food. Rubber plantations were cleared to make way for the production of more valuable food crops. Crops were used to exchange for other food items.</li>
                    <li>For example, the ‘banana notes’ were printed on inferior quality PAPer with no serial numbers and could be forged easily. Banana money was issued and printed in such large quantities that it caused the value to depreciate rapidly. Hence, it led to soaring prices and life to become harder for the locals.</li>
                    <li>With a low level of food resources and banana notes resulting in even further shortages of food, the locals were living in extreme deprivation.</li>

                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>One economic impact of the Japanese Occupation is the high inflation which lead to rationing.</li>
                    <li>Rationing was introduced to control the sale of essential items like rice, salt and sugar. The Japanese military administration imposed strict control over the population and regulated war supplied by issuing many different types of passes. Ration cards were issued to limit the amount of food and other basic necessities received by the civilian population.</li>
                    <li>For example, the ration card specified the date, the items, as well as the quantity of the items that were distributed. Each household was issued with a ‘Peace Living Certificate’ which entitled them to a number of ration cards to purchase essential goods.</li>
                    <li>Hence, as essential food items were being depleted by the large population so quickly, the amount of food and necessities the locals could receive were limited and decreased, leading to further starvation.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The immediate post-war problems which the British failed to fully address, causing people to lose their faith in the British, leading to the development towards a self-governing state.</li>
                    <li>Efforts taken by the British to address the post-war problems proved to be inadequate and ineffective. Rapid population growth caused the post-war problems such as food shortage, unemployment and poor housing to continue on into the 1950s. The problems together with the ineffectiveness of the measures taken by the British caused widespread discontentment amongst the people towards British rule. The population became more conscious that they had to become more responsible for the government and the future of Singapore.</li>
                    <li>For example, the lack of income and use of banana notes during the Japanese Occupation caused many of them to have little or no savings after the change of currency back to the Straits dollar. This led to problems such as disruption of education, unemployment and financial problems which were not addressed by the government. This made life even harder for the people and caused them to lose faith in the British.</li>
                    <li>The sufferings endured during the Japanese Occupation and the ineffectiveness of the government in addressing the problems caused them to lose faith in the British government. This urged the people of Singapore to take up more responsibility and ownership of the governance of Singapore.</li>

Most of the strikes were instigated by the communist-controlled trade unions which urged the workers to fight for better working conditions and higher pay. This was also due to the lost respect for the British for surrendering to the Japanese. People experienced a nationalistic awakening, and no longer wanted to be under British rule.</li>
                    <li>One notable example was the Maria Hertogh Riot. Maria Hertogh was born to Dutch-Eurasian parents. She came under the care of a Muslim woman, Che Aminah, during the Japanese Occupation. Maria Hertogh was thus raised as a Muslim. Maria’s birth parents wanted to be reunited with Maria, which led to a battle over Maria’s custody. The battle for Maria’s custody attracted much media attention and feelings of many Muslims were stirred up as a result. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled that Maria was to be returned to her birth parents. Some Muslims were angry with the Supreme Court’s ruling. They felt that the British were unfair, and had taken the side of the Dutch. Riots broke out and rioters began to attack Europeans and Eurasians.</li>
                    <li>This led to resentment against the British rule, and felt that they were unfair. These strikes and riots heightened the expression of anti-British feelings. The people’s concern for the governing of Singapore, in particular the equality between the races, also showed a stronger sense of belonging. This eventually led to the demand for self-governance.</li>

                <br>
                <p><strong><u>Post-War: Communist Incitement</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The communist incitement hindered the development of Singapore’s self-governance, as it poses the threat of Singapore becoming a communist country, which leads to the British’s unwillingness to give Singapore self-governance.</li>
                    <li>The communist incitement stirred up feelings of the people to demand higher rice rations and cheaper foodstuffs. It formed many trade unions to demand for better working conditions and higher pay. It influenced trade union leaders to organise strikes. The British way of dealing with strikes made the workers even angrier.</li>
                    <li>One example was the Hock Lee Bus Riots in 1955. Workers from Singapore Bus Workers Union (SBWU) went on strike for better pay and working conditions under the influence of the communist controlled trade unions. Chinese students who were influenced by Communists later joined in to support the strikers. The riots resulted in 4 deaths and 31 injured. Even though the riots came to an end, many members of the trade unions were still distrustful of the government and continued to organise rallies and protests. </li>
                    <li>David Marshall seemed unwilling to arrest and imprison the Communists. Thus, the British did not think the Marshall government could protect British interests and counter Communist threats. The British refused to grant Marshall’s request for local ministers to control all internal matters of government, causing Marshall to resign. Hence, the Hock Lee Bus Riots led to the failure to secure internal self-government for Singapore from the British government.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Post-War: Anti-National Service Riots</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The anti-national service riots heightened the expression of anti-British feelings, leading to the development of self-governance.</li>
                    <li>The ruling class was the English-speaking class. It included the local civil servants who were educated through the English-stream schools. The Chinese-educated had difficulty getting jobs, other than going into businesses of their own, starting a little shop or becoming hawkers and so on. Thus, the Chinese middle school students had poor job prospects and felt that they were unfairly treated by the British colonial government. They questioned the willingness of the British to look after their interests.</li>
                    <li>The registration for National Service in 1954 reinforced the students’ views that the British were not concerned about their interests. Many of the Chinese middle school students were upset and did not want their studies to be further disrupted. Some of them were not willing to defend the colonial government which they believed had neglected their interests. On 13 May 1954, about 500 students held a peaceful demonstration against National Service. The British colonial government deployed the police to end the demonstration. Hundreds of students clashed with the police, leaving 26 injured. As a result of the riots, the British colonial government decided to postpone the registration for National Service.</li>
                    <li>This shows that the students cared for Singapore’s governance and were not willing to follow the British rule, but instead, to challenge it. This heightened the expression of anti-British feelings. This event served as a political awakening of the students in Singapore as it made them feel even more strongly against British rule.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Merger: Common Market</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Singapore wanted to propose a merger with Malaya so a common market could be formed, increasing the trade revenue and boosting Singapore’s economy. </li>
                    <li>Singapore lacked natural resources and faced a declining entrepot trade and a growing population which required jobs. Furthermore, the Malayan government introduced import and export tariffs on goods traded between the two countries which reduced the revenue collected from trade.</li>
                    <li>A Common Market could be established so that goods could be traded freely between Singapore and Malay without being taxed. Thus, more profits could be generated as part of the collected revenue was not needed to pay taxes. The Common Market would help to increase trade, expand industries and create more jobs for the local people. Malaya was rich in natural resources, so Singapore would also be able to tap on these resources to support its growth of new industries.</li>
                    <li>This shows that merger with Malaysia would bring Singapore rapid economic growth through increased trade and employment opportunities.</li>

                <br>
                <p><strong><u>Merger: Independence from British</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Singapore hoped to gain full independence from the British rule by merging with Malaya to fight communist rule together.</li>
                    <li>The British showed a lack of confidence in granting independence to Singapore because they feared that Singapore would fall under the hands of the communists. By merging with the strong anti-communist Malaya, Singapore would be able to join forces to suppress and fight communist threat in Singapore. This would also convince the British to grant them independence.</li>
                    <li>Lee Kuan Yew knew Singapore needed it badly, as owing to a break-up in his party, the left-wing extremists had formed a new party, the Barisan Socialis, he could foresee himself having a lot of security trouble on his hands. Merging with Malaya would help settle that problem.</li>
                    <li>The rising communist influence worried Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and the only way to prevent communist threat from spreading any further, Singapore had to merge with Malaya. By doing so, the British would also be forced to grant them independence.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Merger: Communism</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Singapore's POV: The PAP was weakened due to several of its members betraying it and joining the Communists and since PAP was only marginally the majority party in the Parliament, all constituencies were difficult to pass and there was lots of competition. Lots of effort spent trying to fight the communists and opposition parties instead of developing the country, therefore Malaysia being an anti-communist and would have the funds and equipment to get rid of the communists as such, the Merger was required to stop the communists. The Merger therefore, can be seen to be absolutely crucial to the future developments of Singapore and was a necessary step to take, Singapore, therefore also would be able to gain from the merger.
                    </li>
                    <li>Malaysia's POV: Malaya through the merger had also stood to gain a better chance to ensure its stability and protection against communists such that they would be able ensure that they would be safer from communists and through the merger, they would be able to quickly remove a strong communist neighbor and convert them to be capitalist. This would enable them to clear a national threat and thus, Malaya definitely stood to gain through the merger.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Separation: Difference in Political Beliefs</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The differences and disagreements in political beliefs between Malaya and Singapore led to the separation.</li>
                    <li>Malaya and Singapore practised different systems of forming political parties. The political parties in Malaya were formed along racial lines. On the other hand, the political parties in Singapore were multiracial in nature, as the PAP government believed in representing the interests of all communities regardless of race.</li>
                    <li>For example, the ruling party in Kuala Lumpur, the Alliance Party, was made up of three communal parties with each party looking after the needs of its own community. The communal parties are the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) formed by the Malays, the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) formed by the Chinese, the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) formed by the Indians</li>
                    <li>The Central Government in Kuala Lumpur urged the PAP government to adopt a similar system of politics in Singapore. However, Singapore hoped that Malaysia would work towards a multi-racial approach. The differences and disagreements in political views had created tension and disagreement between the two countries, straining their relationship and eventually resulting in separation.</li>

                <br>
                <p><strong><u>Separation: Political Rivalry</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>There was political rivalry between the two countries, as they were competing to have more political power and influence to represent the people, which led to growing tensions and further strained their relationship.</li>
                    <li>The Singapore branches of UMNO, MCA and MIC joined forces with the Singapore Alliance Party (SAP). UMNO was unhappy when SAP failed to win seats in areas that had a Malay majority in Singapore when it participated in the 1963 election. After the election, the Alliance leaders vowed to defeat the PAP in the next election. Such comments affected the relationship between the PAP and the Alliance. In 1964, the PAP participated in the Federal election in Malaya in a bid to establish itself as a Malaysian political party. However, the PAP managed to win one seat and the Alliance party won 89 out of 104 seats in Parliament. Despite its victory, the participation of the PAP in the 1964 Federal election upset the leaders of UMNO and led to further strained relations between the PAP and the Central Government.</li>
                    <li>Malaysia saw Singapore as a political threat and were steadfast in defending their position of having the upper hand in the political ruling of the Federation. They did not want Singapore to gain further control and influence. Singapore won the 1963 elections in Singapore and participated in the 1964 Federal elections, making it seem an even more dominant political force which seeks and threatens to overtake that of the Federal government. The heated competition for political power stirred up feelings of bitterness and resentment for both governments, straining their relationship. They saw each other as political rivals, and both sides highly sought to be the ruling government, not willing to lose out to the other party.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Separation: Malay Privileges</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The disagreement over whether special rights or privileges should be given to Malays led to rising tension as neither party was willing to compromise their political views which they believed strongly in.</li>
                    <li>The PAP government advocated equal opportunities for all regardless of race or religion, as they believed everyone should be given an equal opportunity to succeed. The PAP believed the people’s standard of living would improve through education and industrialisation. Therefore, the Malays did not have special rights in Singapore. However, in Malaysia, special rights were given to the Malays to help them improve their social and economic positions of the Malays.</li>
                    <li>For example, they provided free education for the Malays and also reserved a certain number of government jobs for them.</li>
                    <li>The Central Government in Kuala Lumpur urged the PAP government to adopt a similar system of politics in Singapore. However, Singapore hoped that Malaysia would work towards a multi-racial approach. The differences and disagreements in political views had created tension and disagreement between the two countries, straining their relationship and eventually resulting in separation.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Separation: "Malaysian Malaysia" Campaign</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Singapore campaigned for a “Malaysian Malaysia” which was seen as disrespecting the Malay Special Rights, stirring extreme feelings of hatred and discontentment among the Malays for PAP. </li>
                    <li>In May 1965, the PAP, together with four Malaysian opposition parties, formed the Malaysian Solidarity Convention (MSC). The MSC aimed to achieve a ‘Malaysian Malaysia’, where everyone was to be treated equally regardless of race. UMNO leaders were particularly upset with the MSC as it challenged the special position of the Malay community. Some were so angry that they even called for Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s arrest.</li>
                    <li>For example, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had said that none of the three major racial groups- the Chinese, Malays and Indians- can claim to be more native to Malaysia than the others, which was unlike what the Tunku Abdul Rahman had built Malaya upon, where Malays were given special rights. Contrary to his earlier promise to uphold the Constitution, Mr Lee Kuan Yew insinuated that the concessions to Malays embodied in the Constitution were unreasonable. Later, he took this line even further, coming out with his slogan of a “Malaysian Malaysia”, calling for the abolition of all reserved rights. </li>
                    <li>Due to Singapore’s active and aggressive campaign for a ‘Malaysian Malaysia’, the Malays started to doubt the PAP’s ruling and felt that their interests were being neglected. This led ultimately to heightening tension and distrust between the political parties, UMNO and PAP, as well as the Chinese and Malay races, and eventually separation. Tunku was worried that racial riots would happen again as he realised that many disagreements could not be resolved easily and felt that separation between the two countries was the best solution for preventing any further bloodbath.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong><u>Separation: Spreading of False Rumours</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>False rumours of the PAP’s mistreatment of the Malays sparked racial tensions between the Chinese and Malays, which stirred up feelings of distrust and resentment between the two races.</li>
                    <li>To win back the Malay supporters in Singapore, Syed Ja’afar Albar, the hatchet man of the UMNO leaders, began to organise anti-PAP campaigns by publishing racially sensitive articles in Utusan Melayu, a widely read Malay newsPAPer. Some UMNO leaders accused the PAP government of neglecting Malay interests in Singapore. It stirred the feelings of some Malays against the PAP.</li>
                    <li>For example, when the government wanted to redevelop the areas of Crawford, Kampong Glam and Rochor, about 2,500 families had to relocate, among them were 200 Malay families. However, Utusan Melayu made a false claim that 2,500 Malay families were affected to stir up feelings of discontentment among the Malays towards the PAP government. </li>
                    <li>The false rumours spread by UMNO shows their hostility towards the PAP. The rising racial tensions create tension and discord between the Chinese and Malays, and strains their relationship, which eventually mounts up to racial riots. Disagreements and differences between the two races could not be resolved, hence separation was the only solution left to prevent the possibility of another outbreak of racial riots.</li>

                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>Outbreaks of racial riots were the result of rising racial tension, which left separation the only solution to resolve the disagreements and differences between the races.</li>
                    <li>To win back the Malay supporters in Singapore, Syed Ja’afar Albar, the hatchet man of the UMNO leaders, began to organise anti-PAP campaigns by publishing racially sensitive articles in Utusan Melayu, a widely read Malay newsPAPer. Some UMNO leaders accused the PAP government of neglecting Malay interests in Singapore. It stirred the feelings of some Malays against the PAP.</li>
                    <li>Two serious racial riots took place as a result of racial tension. On 21 July 1964, about 25,000 Malays celebrated the Prophet Mohammed’s birthday by gathering at the Padang. During the celebration, the Malays clashed with the Chinese policemen and it led to the onset of a racial riot. A curfew was imposed islandwide. The first racial riots killed 23 and injured 454 people. After six weeks of calm, another race riot took place in September 1964. By the time the curfew was lifted, 13 people lost their lives and 106 others were injured. </li>

                <p><strong><u>Separation: Disagreements Regarding the Common Market</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>The economic disputes and broken promises formed the foundation of misunderstandings between both leaders.</li>
                    <li>By not abiding by his promise of establishing a Common Market for Singapore, Tunku created a platform of unhappiness between PAP and his party, invalidating Singapore’s reason for being in the Federation in the first place. The Common Market was expected to build over a span of 12 years, allowing Singapore to import and export goods without paying taxes. However, none of these were implemented by the Federation of Malaysia. This meant that Singapore would be required to create more jobs for their people, increasing labour cost of production. This would result in Singapore’s economy to hit a low and fall.</li>
                    <li>Singapore joined Malaysia hoping to enjoy the economic benefits after the Common Market was set up. However, tariffs were still imposed on Singapore-produced goods exported to the other states in Malaysia. Goh Keng Swee made this point that the delay in setting up a Common Market was partly due to the fact that Singapore was seen as an economic rival even though it was now part of Malaysia.</li>
                    <li>With promises being broken, both leaders were unhappy with each other and could not resolve their misunderstandings. as tension arises, their faith and trust within both parties decreased, causing problems. In the Long run, separation is bound to occur. Economic promises broken was, therefore, the most important reason for the separation between Singapore and Malaysia. </li>

                <p><strong><u>Separation: Disagreements Regarding Taxation</u></strong></p>
                <ul class="disclist">
                    <li>There were disagreements regarding taxation fees collected from Singapore, as Malaysia’s demand for higher taxes were seen as unreasonable by Singapore, which led to conflicts.</li>
                    <li>Before the formation of the Federation, Malaya had wanted to collect revenue in Singapore, and give Singapore the amount it needed to run the state. However, Singapore wanted to collect its own revenue and send an agreed sum to the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as taxes. It was eventually agreed that Singapore would collect its own revenue. </li>
                    <li>However, the contribution Singapore had to make to the Central Government was later increased from 40% to 60%. Tan Siew Sin also increased taxes and tried to get Singapore to pay for 25% the national turnover tax and 40% of the payroll tax yields. </li>
                    <li>Singapore felt that it was unfair, as Malaysia was deliberately trying to make it difficult for the PAP to improve the economy of Singapore. The proposed hike in tax contribution was out of proportion to Singapore’s population and size of economy and went against the common market agreement in the merger document. Singapore was upset with Malaysia’s unreasonable demands to raise the taxes collected from Singapore and Malaysia was angry at Singapore’s unwillingness to pay the amount of taxes they demanded. This leads to strains in their relationship due to economic disagreements and conflicts.</li>
