                            <li>Affluence is the state of having wealth that allows people to lead a comfortable lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>Higher income countries are more affluent than middle income countries, hence the citizens generally have more wealth.</li>
                            <li>When people have more wealth, they can spend on more goods and services, resulting in the increased usage of energy resources, food, water, etc.</li>
                            <li>For example, Singapore and USA fall under high-income levels while countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka fall under the middle or lower income levels. Hence, people living in affluent countries such as Singapore usually have a higher demand for goods and services. </li>

                            <li>Developed countries such as USA and UK started industrialisation in the 19th century, while developing countries such as China and Vietnam have started to embark on industrialisation.</li>
                            <li>As more manufacturing activities shift to cheaper locations in developing countries, the price of products fall with lower labour cost, enabling more people to consume goods.</li>
                            <li>For example, China has shifted towards a manufacturing-based economy from an agriculture-based economy since the late 1970s, surpassing USA in 2010 to become the world’s largest manufacturing country, producing 19.8% of the world’s manufactured goods.</li>

                    <li>Economic Impact from Food Wastage
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>A 2019 study by Singapore Environmental Council (SEC) found that Singapore households throw away around S$342 million in unconsumed food annually. SEC estimated that on average, Singapore households throw away an estimated S$6.57 million worth of food per week.</li>
                            <li>Hence, due to wasteful consumption habits, money is wasted on food that will be thrown away when unconsumed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Environmental Impact from Food Transportation and Increasing Food Miles
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Food miles are defined as the distance food travels from the farm where it is produced to the plate of the final consumer. Some food is produced locally and may only travel a few miles, while most supermarkets buy food from international countries.</li>
                            <li>Greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere as fossil fuels are used for production, packaging and transportation of food, resulting in more greenhouses gases trapping more heat, increasing temperatures and global warming.</li>
                            <li>For example, in 2005, the import of fruits, nuts, and vegetables into California by airplane released more than 70 000 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to more than 12 000 cars on the road.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>In order to produce enough food to meet increasing food demands, deforestation occurs as forests are cleared to make more land for agricultural purposes.</li>
                            <li>This may lead to further impacts such as soil erosion, loss of wildlife sites, and loss of biodiversity. Agricultural activities can also lead to the overuse of pesticides that pollute rivers.</li>

                    <li>Unsafe Working Environment (Social Impact)
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>In order to meet the riisng demands from consumers, workers may have to work in unfavourable conditions. Most unfavourable working conditions in factories are located in Less Developed Countires (LDCs) due to migrants attempting to escape extreme poverty, along with many other reasons.</li>
                            <li>Unsafe working environments put workers’ lives at risk as there may be poor electrical wiring, insufficient exits and little firefighting equipment in factories.</li>
                            <li>For example, on 24 April 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-storey commercial building owned by the clothing industry collapsed in the capital of Bangladesh, resulting in 1 129 deaths.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Low Income (Economic Impact)
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Most workers in LDCs receive low income albeit working in industries that generate large amounts of cash annually. </li>
                            <li>For example, even though a labour passed in 2013 that allows employees in Bangladesh to form labour unions that increase their minimum wage from US$38/month to US$68/month, this figure remains below the average wages of textile workers in other countries.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Clothing factories are able to cause water pollution as bleach and detergent are released into nearby water bodies, such as rivers and ponds.</li>
                            <li>For example, at the Jinxin Dyeing Plant in China, cotton is lowered into vats of dye and doused in indigo colour, releasing tons of wastewater.</li>

                    <li>Practice 5Rs
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>The 5Rs refer to Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle, and Refuse.</li>
                            <li>Using the 5Rs, we are able to minimise the amount of waste that goes to landfills, by reducing the volume of waste by incineration and recycling, reusing and reducing the amount of waste at source. </li>
                            <li>For example, Singapore’s last remaining landfill is Semakau Landfill. 200 000 tonnes of solid waste, as well as all incineration ash produced in Singapore is sent to Semakau Landfill, and it is projected to run out of space by around 2035. If we practised the 5Rs, we can increase the percentage of waste recycled to 70%, thus lengthening the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reducing Food Miles
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>By purchasing goods produced locally instead of goods imported from other countries, we are able to reduce food miles. </li>
                            <li>For example, local producers met less than 10% of Singapore’s nutritional needs in 2019, while Singapore imported more than 90% of its food supply. By 2030, homegrown produce could meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs, easing its reliance on imports and reducing its vulnerability to supply disruptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fair Trade
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Fair trade is an international movement that aims to give better prices, improved working conditions, local sustainability and fairer terms of trade for farmers and workers in developing and less developed countries.</li>
                            <li>Fair trade sets out to help underprivileged producers move towards self-sufficiency and sustainability.</li>
                            <li>For example, Kuapa Kokoo, a co-operative of farmers located in Ghana, sells part of its cocoa bean crop to Divine Chocolate Ltd in the UK. This helps the farmers receive an extra US$150 per tonne for their cocoa, which is about 10% more than the usual price on the world market. Moreover, farmers receive training to help them deal with problems such as pests or diseases that affect the cocoa crop.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Causes of Deforestation</u></strong></p>

                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>The conversion of forests into agricultural plantations for agricultural activities is a major cause of deforestation.</li>
                            <li>Agriculture refers to the growing of crops and raising of animals to provide food. The rate of deforestation increased greatly with the introduction of large-scale commercial agricultural activities on plantations. These plantations are obtained by burning and clearing large areas of the rainforest. The crops from plantations are grown for cash and are sold to meet both local and global needs.</li>
                            <li>By 2010, about 242 000 square kilometres of the Amazon rainforest have been converted into soya bean farms. Soya beans on top of being food for human consumption is also a major ingredient for cattle feed.</li>
                            <li>Hence, the rising global demand for food has fuelled deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in order to make way for large commercial farms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cattle Ranching
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Cattle ranching is one of the main causes of deforestation.</li>
                            <li>Cattle ranching involves operating large farms to raise cattle. Large areas of rainforest are cleared to create lad for cattle to graze on.</li>
                            <li>For example, 80% of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is caused by land cleared for cattle ranching. The number of cattle heads have increased from less than 10 million in 1986 to 79 million in 2011.</li>
                            <li>Hence, an increase in the demand for beef has resulted in the rise in the rate of cattle ranching, leading to an increase of deforested land area for large farms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Logging
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Logging of trees is a major cause of deforestation.</li>
                            <li>Logging refers to the cutting down of trees for timber, which can be used to make furniture, building materials and charcoal. Growing demand for timber products increases logging activities. Logging not only reduces the number of trees but damages the rainforest as a whole. For every tree extracted, 5 are badly damaged as the falling tree will destroy the surrounding trees and smaller sized plants. Removal of the tree also leaves the soil exposed to erosion.</li>
                            <li>For example, China’s huge demand for timber for making disposable chopsticks and paper has resulted in heavy logging in the rainforests of Congo and Cameroon in Central Africa, Brazil and Indonesia.</li>
                            <li>Hence, the worldwide increase in demand for timber, especially in countries like China with a large consumer base, has led to a higher rate of deforestation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mining
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Demand for precious minerals has resulted in the mining of forests which leads to deforestation.</li>
                            <li>Precious metals and gemstones such as gold, copper and diamonds are found beneath many tropical rainforests. Forests are cleared to establish mines and construct roads to transport the mined materials.</li>
                            <li>For example, the Carajas Mine in Brazil has a rich variety of mineral reserves. In 2007, 296 million tonnes of iron ore were extracted from the mine, which is estimated to contain 18 billion tonnes of minerals including gold and copper. Many electronic products such as computers and telephones have gold components. Copper is mostly used to make electrical wires.</li>
                            <li>Hence, a rise in demand for valuable material leads to the clearing of forest to set up mines, therefore leading to deforestation.</li>

                <p><strong><u>Impacts of Deforestation</u></strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Loss of Biodiversity
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity, which is an environmental impact.</li>
                            <li>Deforestation depletes biodiversity by destroying habitats, by separating connecting areas of rainforest from each other and by interfering with plant reproduction. When canopy trees are cut, many smaller forest trees and plants dependent upon them for shade or support or moisture vanish. Animals dependent upon trees or other vegetation for food, shelter, water and breeding sites also disappear. Only animals that can migrate to connecting forests areas survive. Plants in cut-over areas often cannot be pollinated, and if they are, their seeds fall upon unsuitable open areas where they cannot survive. In addition, many rainforests species are restricted to relatively small areas and are found nowhere else. When the areas in which these species reside are logged or burned, they will disappear. </li>
                            <li>For example, with the unsustainable logging of mahogany, two of its species, the Caribbean and Pacific Coast mahoganies, are now virtually extinct. Moreover, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has listed mahogany as an endangered species.</li>
                            <li>As a result, deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Deforestation leads to an increase in floods.</li>
                            <li>Tree roots hold onto the soil. Thus, loss of ground cover due to deforestation results in flash floods during heavy rainfall, which leads to soil erosion. When there are no trees, the soil is washed away into the river, reducing the capacity of the river, leading to an increased in flood risk. Forests are needed as resilience in natural ecosystems. They buffer against extreme floods, and rainforests benefit all who live downstream by reducing soil erosion and flooding. Floods and erosion will cause severe constraints on food production throughout the world before the end of the century by eroding topsoil, flooding rice fields, and filling in irrigation canals. Energy production has been reduced from many reservoirs due to siltation.</li>
                            <li>For instance, in 1979, India suffered $2 billion in property damage and numerous lives in the Ganges Valley partly because of deforestation in northern India and Nepal.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, deforestation causes frequent floods as the clearing of trees results in soil erosion. It also prevents the trees from protecting people against floods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Climate Change
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Deforestation would lead to climate change by destroying the forest.</li>
                            <li>Forests play a huge role in the carbon cycle of our planet by being a main carbon sink. When trees are being cut down, not only would the carbon dioxide intake reduce, but carbon stored within the trees would be released as carbon dioxide. Decomposition of the tree later on would further add onto the amount of carbon produced into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide being a greenhouse gas, would aggravate the greenhouse effect when the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. This causes a rise in global temperature which would result in climate change.</li>
                            <li>For example, in the Amazon rainforest, trees are estimated to contain more carbon than 10 years’ worth of human-produced greenhouse gases. Trees are often cleared with fire, further increasing the amount of carbon dioxide.</li>
                            <li>Hence, deforestation causes enhanced greenhouse effects and global warming.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Destruction of Renewable Resources
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>One of the economic impacts of deforestation is the destruction of renewable resources.</li>
                            <li>Deforestation can rob a country of potential renewable revenues. Tropical forests provide important renewable resources required by industries. Logging can be a sustainable activity which is a stable source of revenue. However, materials are extracted and overexploited faster than it can generate hence depleting the source of such material. When this occurs, products are not able to be made or sold which reduces potential revenue for the nation. Loss of jobs in such industries further aggravate the economic loss in nations.</li>
                            <li>For example, the Philippines, a major log exporter in the 1980s, has seen a virtual cessation in log exports due to dwindling harvestable forest resources. </li>
                            <li>Therefore, with the increasing rate of deforestation, the destruction of renewable resources will also increase and such resources face risk of extinction hence leading to the loss in potential revenue.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Impact on Indigenous People and Culture
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Deforestation may cause the loss of homes for the indigenous tribes who had made the forest their home for centuries. </li>
                            <li>Tropical rainforests are home to millions of native people who make livings through subsistence agriculture, hunting, or harvesting forest products such as nuts and rubber. Deforestation via logging, mining or farming in tropical forests sometimes displace the indigenous communities. These communities are then left without land or resources which results in them disintegrating and moving to a densely populated area. </li>
                            <li>For example, the Guarani tribe are affected by the loss of most of their land in the last century. Waves of deforestation have converted the once fertile Guarani homeland, occupying 350 000 square kilometres, into a vast network of cattle ranches, and sugar cane plantations for Brazil’s biofuels market, leaving the Guarani with a tiny patch of land surrounded by cattle ranches and sugar cane farms.</li>
                            <li>Hence, most of them were forced to squeeze in small reservations and lost their ability to hunt and fish which leads to malnutrition in children. On top of that, the densely populated houses also led to health issues such as starvation and also facilitated the spread of diseases hence affecting the people.</li>
                        </ul>
