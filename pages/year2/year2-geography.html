                            <li>Affluence is the state of having wealth that allows people to lead a comfortable lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>Higher income countries are more affluent than middle income countries, hence the citizens generally have more wealth.</li>
                            <li>When people have more wealth, they can spend on more goods and services, resulting in the increased usage of energy resources, food, water, etc.</li>
                            <li>For example, Singapore and USA fall under high-income levels while countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka fall under the middle or lower income levels. Hence, people living in affluent countries such as Singapore usually have a higher demand for goods and services. </li>

                            <li>Developed countries such as USA and UK started industrialisation in the 19th century, while developing countries such as China and Vietnam have started to embark on industrialisation.</li>
                            <li>As more manufacturing activities shift to cheaper locations in developing countries, the price of products fall with lower labour cost, enabling more people to consume goods.</li>
                            <li>For example, China has shifted towards a manufacturing-based economy from an agriculture-based economy since the late 1970s, surpassing USA in 2010 to become the world’s largest manufacturing country, producing 19.8% of the world’s manufactured goods.</li>

                            <li>Due to increasing economic development, high income countries are able to afford more resources in order to meet the increasing demand.</li>

                    <li>Economic Impact from Food Wastage
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>A 2019 study by Singapore Environmental Council (SEC) found that Singapore households throw away around S$342 million in unconsumed food annually. SEC estimated that on average, Singapore households throw away an estimated S$6.57 million worth of food per week.</li>
                            <li>Hence, due to wasteful consumption habits, money is wasted on food that will be thrown away when unconsumed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Environmental Impact from Food Transportation and Increasing Food Miles
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Food miles are defined as the distance food travels from the farm where it is produced to the plate of the final consumer. Some food is produced locally and may only travel a few miles, while most supermarkets buy food from international countries.</li>
                            <li>Greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere as fossil fuels are used for production, packaging and transportation of food, resulting in more greenhouses gases trapping more heat, increasing temperatures and global warming.</li>
                            <li>For example, in 2005, the import of fruits, nuts, and vegetables into California by airplane released more than 70 000 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to more than 12 000 cars on the road.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Environmental Impact from Food Production
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>In order to produce enough food to meet increasing food demands, deforestation occurs as forests are cleared to make more land for agricultural purposes.</li>
                            <li>This may lead to further impacts such as soil erosion, loss of wildlife sites, and loss of biodiversity. Agricultural activities can also lead to the overuse of pesticides that pollute rivers.</li>

                    <li>Unsafe Working Environment (Social Impact)
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>In order to meet the riisng demands from consumers, workers may have to work in unfavourable conditions. Most unfavourable working conditions in factories are located in Less Developed Countires (LDCs) due to migrants attempting to escape extreme poverty, along with many other reasons.</li>
                            <li>Unsafe working environments put workers’ lives at risk as there may be poor electrical wiring, insufficient exits and little firefighting equipment in factories.</li>
                            <li>For example, on 24 April 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-storey commercial building owned by the clothing industry collapsed in the capital of Bangladesh, resulting in 1 129 deaths.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Low Income (Economic Impact)
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Most workers in LDCs receive low income albeit working in industries that generate large amounts of cash annually. </li>
                            <li>For example, even though a labour passed in 2013 that allows employees in Bangladesh to form labour unions that increase their minimum wage from US$38/month to US$68/month, this figure remains below the average wages of textile workers in other countries.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Water Pollution (Environmental Impact)
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Clothing factories are able to cause water pollution as bleach and detergent are released into nearby water bodies, such as rivers and ponds.</li>
                            <li>For example, at the Jinxin Dyeing Plant in China, cotton is lowered into vats of dye and doused in indigo colour, releasing tons of wastewater.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Practice 5Rs
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>The 5Rs refer to Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle, and Refuse.</li>
                            <li>Using the 5Rs, we are able to minimise the amount of waste that goes to landfills, by reducing the volume of waste by incineration and recycling, reusing and reducing the amount of waste at source. </li>
                            <li>For example, Singapore’s last remaining landfill is Semakau Landfill. 200 000 tonnes of solid waste, as well as all incineration ash produced in Singapore is sent to Semakau Landfill, and it is projected to run out of space by around 2035. If we practised the 5Rs, we can increase the percentage of waste recycled to 70%, thus lengthening the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reducing Food Miles
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>By purchasing goods produced locally instead of goods imported from other countries, we are able to reduce food miles. </li>
                            <li>For example, local producers met less than 10% of Singapore’s nutritional needs in 2019, while Singapore imported more than 90% of its food supply. By 2030, homegrown produce could meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs, easing its reliance on imports and reducing its vulnerability to supply disruptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fair Trade
                        <ul class="circlelist">
                            <li>Fair trade is an international movement that aims to give better prices, improved working conditions, local sustainability and fairer terms of trade for farmers and workers in developing and less developed countries.</li>
                            <li>Fair trade sets out to help underprivileged producers move towards self-sufficiency and sustainability.</li>
                            <li>For example, Kuapa Kokoo, a co-operative of farmers located in Ghana, sells part of its cocoa bean crop to Divine Chocolate Ltd in the UK. This helps the farmers receive an extra US$150 per tonne for their cocoa, which is about 10% more than the usual price on the world market. Moreover, farmers receive training to help them deal with problems such as pests or diseases that affect the cocoa crop.</li>
