                            <h2>Problems faced by historians</h2>
                            <h4><u>Insufficient Evidence</u></h4>
                            <p>When a historian has insufficient information to write about an event, he would have a limited understanding of the past. Objects and matierlas decay over time. As places develop, these objects and materials will also get destroyed.</p>
                            <p>One notable example is the Singapore stone. The Singapore stone dates back to the 12th century, and the text inscribed on the stone is undecipherable. Thus, it is difficult for historians to use the stone in their understanding of what Singapore was like in the 12th century.</p>
                            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0cTHk1y.png" alt="a picture of the Singapore stone" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;"></p>
                            <p>Another example is the Xia Dynasty. The Xia Dynasty is purported to have been the earliest Chinese dynasty with a history of over 4 000 years, evidence for its existence lies mostly in written accounts from the Shang dynasty (Bamboo Annals). With a lack of physical artefacts to study and analyse, it is hard for historians to say what life was like during the Xia Dynasty, or if the dynasty even existed at all.</p>
