## <b>1. Abiotic and Biotic Factors</b>

Ecology is the study of the relationship between organisms (biotic environment), as well as how these organisms interact with their physical environment (abiotic environment.) 

## The Abiotic Environment

<em>Abiotic factors are non-living components of the ecosystem, which include all the physical factors that influence the organisms such as light, temperature, pH, etc.</em>

### Light intensity
- Affects the growth of plants and animals
- Green plants (with chlorophyll) exist only where there is a sufficient amount of light required to undergo photosynthesis
- Many animals require light to see, hunt, and detect potential dangers, such as predators. On the other hand, some animals are adapted to live in conditions with little or no light.

### Temperature
- Affects the rate of metabolism in plants and animals
- Most organisms cannot tolerate extreme temperatures (too high or too low)
- Plants are able to survive through seasons such as summer and winter by:
  1. storing good in underground storage organs
  2. shedding leaves to reduce water loss
  3. producing seeds which are resistant to extreme temperatures
- Some animals are adapted physically (e.g. blubber in bears) and/or behaviourally (e.g. hibernation) to survive extreme temperatures

### Water Availability
- Affects the population size and location of plants and animals
- No living organism can survive without water
- Some animals (e.g. camels) and plants (e.g. cacti) are adapted to survive in areas with limited water supply.
  - Plants adapted to survive with little water may show some of these adaptations:
    1. young leaves are shed or are reduced to spines so as to lower the rate of transpiration
    2. fleshy stems store up water
    3. green stems take over the function of photosynthesis from leaves
- Some animals (e.g. fishes) and plants (e.g. hydrilla) are adapted to survive in aquatic environments.

### Oxygen Content
- Most organisms require oxygen to survive
- They cannot survive in environments with low oxygen content, unless they have special adaptations to obtain sufficient oxygen

### Salinity
- Aquatic organisms are affected by the concentration of salt in the water due to the difference in water potential between their cells and the aquatic environment
- For example, freshwater organisms tend to have excess water entering the body cells by osmosis. Some adaptions to prevent rupturing of cells include having rigid cell walls in plants and contractile vacuooles in unicellular organisms such as the <em>paramecium</em>

### pH
- Acidity or alkalinity of soil water or aquatic habitats influences the types of organisms that can live in that environment
- Aquatic organisms are sensitive to pH of the water. They may die if there is a drastic or sudden change in pH

Abiotic factors can influence a species' ability to survive. Every species is able to survive within a range of each of these factors called the <b><u>species' tolerance range</u></b>.

- Tolerance range is the range within which a species can exist (high + low population).
- The optimal range is the range within which a speicies is best adapted. It thrives with a high population.
- Near the upper and lower limits of the tolerance range, individuals experience stress.
- This will reduce the species'
  1. health
  2. rate of growth
  3. reproduction


## The Biotic Environment

<em>Biotic factors are living components of the ecosystem, which include all the living organisms that influence other organisms such as predator and prey.</em>

Each species of organism has a unique and specific role to play within the ecosystem and this role is referred to as its <b>niche</b>. It includes what the organism feeds, how it obtains its food, who preys on it, how it reproduces, etc.

Each species has a niche that differs in certain ways from the niches of the other species in the same ecosystem. No two species will have identical niches within the same ecosystem.

An organism cannot survive on its own. Living organisms evolved to have different relationships between each other. These <b>interrelationships</b> help to <b>keep the balance in an ecosystem</b>.

### Symbiotic Relationships

The type of interaction between organisms depends on whether one benefits, loses or gains nothing from the relationship. Some interactions in a community include:

- Predation
  - a carnivorous/omnivorous organism (predator) feeds on another organism (prey) 
  - e.g. a tiger feeds on a deer
- Parasitism 
  - one species (a parasite) lives at the expense of another species (the host)
  - e.g. a tapeworm living in vertebrate hosts
- Mutualism 
  - two species living together where both species benefit from the relationship
  - e.g. sea anemones and clownfish.
- Commensalism
  - two species living together where one species benefits but the other is neither farmed nor benefits
  - e.g. barnacles living on whales


## <b>2. Energy Transfer Process in the Ecosystem</b>

## Non-Cyclic Energy Flow

<b>Energy flow in the ecosystem is unidirectional and cannot be recycled.</b> Thus, energy has to be constantly supplied to the ecosystem.

Energy enters most ecosystems as light energy from the sun, which is the ultimate source of energy.

This energy is converted into chemical energy by the photosynthetic organisms via photosynthesis, and is transferred from one organism to another organism through feeding as carbon compounds.

<b>Photosynthesis</b> is the process in which light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll is transformed into chemical energy:
![\color{blue}
CO_{2} + H_{2}O \rightarrow O_2 + C_6H_12O_6](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ccolor%7Bblue%7D%0ACO_%7B2%7D+%2B+H_%7B2%7DO+%5Crightarrow+O_2+%2B+C_6H_12O_6)

Energy is lost to the environment as heat during respiration as it flows through the ecosystem.

<b>Cellular</b> respiration is the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen, with the release of a large amount of energy. Carbon dioxide and water are released in the process:
![\color{blue}
O_2 + C_6H_12O_6 \rightarrow CO_{2} + H_{2}O](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ccolor%7Bblue%7D%0AO_2+%2B+C_6H_12O_6+%5Crightarrow+CO_%7B2%7D+%2B+H_%7B2%7DO)

## Energy Flow in an Ecosystem

1. The sun is the ultimate source of energy for ecosystems. However, only 1% of the light energy reaching the earth's atmosphere enters the ecosystems.

2. Light energy is captured by the producers or photoautotrophs (e.g. green plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria) and converted to organic compounds (i.e. chemical energy) during photosynthesis.

3. Other organisms or heterotrophs in the ecosystems obtain chemical energy by feeding on another organism. They are also known as consumers. The level at which an organism feeds in the sequence of energy transfer is called a <b>trophic level</b>.
  - Producers are at the first trophic level
  - Herbivores feeding on producers are primary consumers. They are at the second trophic level.
  - Carnivores feeding on herbivores are secondary consumers. They are at the third trophic level.
  - Carnivores feeding on the herbivores are secondary consumers. They are at the third trophic level.
  - The top predator is also known as the apex predator.

4. Only a small amount of chemical energy (~10%) is passed on from one trophic level to the next. ABout 90% of the energy is lost to the environment as:
  - heat during respiration
  - uneaten body parts
  - undigested matter
  - excretory products

5. Dead organisms, undigested products (faeces) and excretory products contain trapped chemical energy. This energy is released when decomposers (e.g. bacteria and fungi) break down the organic materials to inorganic materials. Decomposers use some of the trapped chemical energy for their needs and the rest is lost as heat. The inorganic materials return to the physical environment and are used again by green plants.

## Food Chains and Food Webs

Populations of the various species in an ecosystem live interdependently.

Energy is passed from one trophic level to another in the ecosystem through feeding. The feeding relationships between the organisms in an ecosystem can be represented by food chains.

A <b>food chain</b> involves a series of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food. It usually begins with a producer as it is the only organism that can manufacture organic food from inorganic raw materials.

Generally, food chains do not have more than five trophic levels, because:
  - inadequate amount of energy in the ecosystem to support more than 5 trophic levels. Only 1% of the light energy from the sun is trapped by producers and only 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next trophic level.
  - difficult to have larger species to feed on the tertiary consumers which are already very large in size.
  - the food chain will be more unstable if there are more trophic levels. In a very long food chain, species are more likely to be threatened with extinction when a population of the species that it preyed on decreases in population size.

A limitation of food chinas is that they do not reflect the complex feeding relationships that exist is most communities. They only show a simple, linear feeding relationship, thus giving a false impression that each organism feeds on only one type of organism. In fact, most organisms feed on more than one type of food. Therefore, each organism is involved in many different food chains, all complexly intertwined and interconnected to form a community food web.

A food web consists of many interlinked food chains and reflects all the possible transfers of energy and nutrients among organisms in a community.

## <b>3. Nutrient Cycles in the Ecosystem</b>

## Recycling of Nutrients in Living Organisms

Decomposers such as bacteria and fungi feed on decaying organic matters.
They break down dead bodies of organisms and faeces. Decomposers' activities return nutrients to the environment.

## The Carbon Cycle

Carbon is an important component of many compounds that supports life.

The carbon cycle shows the pathways by which carbon is being removed from and released into the environment, in the form of carbon dioxide.

This cycling of carbon dioxide in the environment constantly maintains its concentration at about 0.04% of the atmospheric air.

The importances of carbon cycles include:
  - ensuring that there is a continuous supply of carbon dioxide for plants to carry out photosynthesis, so that energy can be transferred from one organism to another in the form of carbon compounds, thus sustaining the lives of non-photosynthesizing organisms in the food chain.

Carbon/carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by:
  - <b>photosynthesis</b>
    - carbon dioxide is taken in by green plants and converted to glucose.
  - <b>feeding</b>
    - animals directly or indirectly obtain the carbon compounds from green plants through feeding.
  - <b>formation of fossil fuels</b>
    - carbon compounds in dead organisms are preserved over millions of years in fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas.

Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by:
  - <b>respiration</b>
    - oxidation of the glucose to release energy. Carbon dioxide is formed when plants, animals and decomposers require.
  - <b>decomposition</b>
    - when organisms die, their bodies are broken down into simpler substances by the decomposers, releasing carbon dioxide in the process.
  - <b>combustion
    - burning of fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas.

## Carbon Sinks

A <b>carbon sink</b> is an area that sores carbon compounds for an indefinite period. It stores more carbon than it releases. Hence, a carbon sink is a carbon reservoir.

There are two main natural carbon sinks - forests and oceans.

Carbon sinks help to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and this helps to reduce the rate of global warming.

A carbon sink can always turn into a carbon source. For example, the burning of forests releases carbon, effectively turning it into a carbon source.

#### Oceans

- Oceans are the largest carbon sinks on Earth.
- About one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities is absorbed by oceans.
- Driven by two processes: <b>solubility</b> and <b>photosynthesis</b>.
- Carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean's water is absorbed and used by phyyoplankton and algae in photosynthesis.
- Some carbon compounds are buried in the seabed in the form of fossil fuels.
- Increasing temperatures of waters reduces the ability of oceans to dissolve carbon dioxide.

#### Forests

- Atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis.
- Large amounts of carbon compounds are stored in trees.
- When trees die, their remains may be buried deep in the ground.
- After millions of years, these remains form coal.

## Carbon Sources

Carbon sources are areas that <b>releases more carbon than it stores</b>. Examples of natural carbon sources are volcanoes, natural fires,
