# Kissing in Vietnamese
#### (by Ocean Vuong)

My grandmother kisses <br>
as if bombs are bursting in the backyard, <br>
where mint and jasmine lace their perfumes <br>
through the kitchen window, <br>
as if somewhere, a body is falling apart <br>
and flames are making their way back <br>
through the intricacies of a young boy's thigh, <br>
as if to walk out the dor, your torso <br>
would dance from exit wounds. <br>
When my grandmother kisses, there would be <br>
no flashy smooching, no western music <br>
of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe <br>
you inside her, nose pressed to check <br>
so that your scent is relearned <br>
and your sweat pearls into drops of gold <br>
inside her lungs, as if while she holds you <br>
death alos, is clutching your wrist. <br>
My grandmother kisses as if history <br>
never ended, as if somewhere <br>
a body is still <br>
falling apart. <br>

> Title: Kissing in Vietnamese 
- "Kissing"
    - an action that symbolises affection and love
- "Vietnamese"
    - name of a language or race
    - Vietnam War

<br><br>

> "my grandmother kisses as if bombs are bursting in the background"
- grandmother kisses with a desperation that at any moment, both she and her grandson could be killed
- "in the background"
    - very close to their home
    - within their compound
- the grandmother is haunted by the experiences of bombs that had killed many Vietnamese during the Vietnam War

<br><br>

> "as if somewhere, a body is falling apart"
- the Vietnamese have suffered grevious losses
- families torn apart or destroyed
- imagery of someone being disintegrated (killed by a bomb blast)

<br><br>

> "and flames are making their way back through the intricacies of a young boy's thigh"
- imagery of burn wound from bombs on a boy, gives the reader an impression of the immense pain of which the young boy is feeling
- the grandmother has witnessed this situation before, traumatic experience

<br><br>

> "no flashy smooching"
- not the type of kissing that appears on Netflix shows and goes on for 2 minutes
- not for show, but rather sincere, family love

<br><br>

> "so that your scent is relearned"
- smell is an important and memorable sense
- can bring nostalgia and triggers a lot of memories
- grandmother holds on to grandson in any way that she can because she doesn't want to lose him

<br><br>

> "and your sweat pearls into drops of gold"
- dead people cannot sweat, only living people can sweat
- this shows that the grandson's sweat is valuable as gold to the grandmother as it shows that the grandsom is alive and well, with a functioning body

<br><br>

> "as if while she holds you, death also, is clutching your wrist"
- 'tug-of-war' between the grandmother and death
- shows how the grandmother loves the persona deeply and is not going to allow death to take her grandson away from her
