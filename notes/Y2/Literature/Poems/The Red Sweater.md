# The Red Sweater
#### (by Joseph O. Legaspi)

slides down into my body, soft<br>
lambs wool, what everybody<br>
in school is wearing and for me <br>
to have it my mother worked twenty <br>
hours at the fast-food joint. <br>
The sweater fits like a lover, <br>
sleeves snug, thin on the waist. <br>
As I run my fingers through the knit, <br>
I see my mother over the hot oil in the fryers <br>
dipping a strainer full of stringed potatoes.<br>
In a twenty hour period my mother waits on hundreds of customers: she pushes <br>
each order under ninety seconds, slaps <br>
the refried beans she mashed during prep time, <br>
the lull before rush hours, onto steamed tortillas, <br>
the room's pressing heat melting her make-up. <br>
How many buritos can one make in a continuous day? <br>
How many pounds of onions, lettuce and tomatoes <br>
pass through the slicer? How do her wrists <br>
sustain the scraping, lifting and flipping <br>
of meat patties?       And twenty<br>
hours are merely links <br>
in the chain of days startlingly similar, <br>
that begin in the blue morning with my mother <br>
putting on her polyester uniform, which, <br>
even when it's newly-washed, smells <br>
of mashed beans and cooked ground beef.

> "what everybody in school is wearing"
- albeit expensive, the sweater is seen as a social norm, and it is what most people in school wears.

<br><br>

> "and for me to have it my mother worked twenty hours at the fast food joint"
- mother works a menial, backbreaking job
- hardworking and willing to endure gruellingly long hours of work to afford what her child wants
- represents parent's self-sacrificial love for their child
- the mother bought the sweater for the persona as she is worried for her child to fit in at school

<br><br>

> "I see my mother over the hot oil 
- persona understands the pains of her mother
- mother does even the most difficult parts of her job to meet her end goal

<br><br>

> "And twenty hours are merely links in the chain of days startlingly similar,"
- represents the monotonous, exhausting daily life of the mother

<br><br>

> "even when it's newly-washed, smells of mashed beans and cooked ground beef."
- shows how the mother works so hard that the scent of the food from the fast food joint seeps into her uniform

### What impression does the mother give?

- Hardworking
    - The mother works "20 hours" in a fast food joint to sustain her and her family.
    - This shows that, despite the low salary that the fast food joint offers, the mother works painstakingly long hours in order to be able to earn a living. This shows how the mother is determinated and persistent, and does even the most difficult parts of her job to meet her end goal.
    - Moreover, the mother's uniform always smells of "mashed beans and cooked ground beef", even when newly-washed.
    - This suggests that the mother works for so long at the fast food joint daily that the scent of the food at the restaurant has seeped into her clothing. This reinforces how the mother endures lengthy shifts at the fast food restaurant.
- Loving
    - In order for the mother to buy the persona a sweater to wear at school, she had to work twenty hours at a fast food joint.
    - This shows how the persona's mother is willing to work insanely long hours just to buy her child a sweater. Hence, this shows how the mother cares for the persona, working strenous jobs to get what the persona wants.
