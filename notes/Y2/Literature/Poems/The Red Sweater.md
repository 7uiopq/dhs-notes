# The Red Sweater
(by Joseph O. Legaspi)

slides down into my body, soft<br>
lambs wool, what everybody<br>
in school is wearing na dfor me <br>
to have it my mother worked twenty <br>
hours at the fast-food joint. <br>
The sweater fits like a lover, <br>
sleeves snug, thin on the waist. <br>
As I run my fingers through the waist <br>
