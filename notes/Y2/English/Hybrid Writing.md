# Hybrid Writing

## What is a Hybrid Text?

A hybrid text is a single text with a dual purpose: to integrate narrative and informational text. It presents important information about a specific topic using narrative text as the primary means of expression - for example, to teach scientific information.

A hybrid text is also referred to as an informational storybook, a blended or mixed-genre text. It is an engaging genre that artfully inegrates two genres of writing:

- Personal Recount
- Reflective
- Descriptive
- Expository
