# DHS Notes

Welcome to my repository. In here, you will find my notes in my secondary school journey in Dunman High for all subjects.

Please do take a look around!

However, if you are **not a Dunman High student**, please **refrain from distributing and sharing without my permission** these notes, as these notes are only allowed to be internally distributed with the owner's permission.
