# DHS Notes
### Hi there!
Welcome to my repository. In here, you will find my notes in my secondary school journey in Dunman High for all subjects.

Please do take a look around! 

If you are a student currently studying in Dunman High, feel free to use my notes as your reference when studying. However, if you are **not a Dunman High student**, please **refrain from distributing and sharing** these notes, as these notes are only allowed to be internally distributed.

If you would like to help out and commit pull requests to my notes, please do so! Make sure your pull requests are helpful and valid.

#### Disclaimer:
If you happen to get low marks on any exam while using my notes for revision, don't blame or flame. Keep your cool and be civilised. Please proceed at your own risk, and if you feel like my notes are insufficient/inaccurate, help other people out by creating a PR or leaving a respectful comment with constructive, specific feedback.

### Guidelines:
- All notes are copyright and belong to the creator (which is me).
- Practice **integrity**, do not copy or plagiarise my notes.
- For internal circulation **only**.
- Ensure that PRs are valid and helpful. Do not spam PRs.
- Be kind.
