# DHS Notes
### Hi there!
Welcome to my repository. In here, you will find my notes in my secondary school journey in Dunman High for all subjects.

Please do take a look around! 

If you are a student currenly studying in Dunman High, feel free to use my notes as your reference when studying. However, if you are **not a Dunman High student**, please **refrain from distributing and sharing** these notes, as these notes are only allowed to be internally distributed.

Guidelines:
- All notes are copyright and belong to the creator (which is me).
- Practice **integrity**, do not copy or plagiarise my notes.
- For internal circulation **only**.
