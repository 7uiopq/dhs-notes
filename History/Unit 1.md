- Credibility
  - Is the source trustworthy/reliable?
- Consistency
  - Are the statements in the source consistent?
  - The statements in the source should not contradict each other.
- Corroboration
  - Is the evidence supported by other evidence and historical accounts?
  - The evidence collected has to agree with other available evidence of the same topic/issue.
