## Introduction

Ecology is the study of the relationship between organisms (biotic environment), as well as how these organisms interact with their physical environment (abiotic environment.) 

## The Abiotic Environment

<em>Abiotic factors are non-living components of the ecosystem, which include all the physical factors that influence the organisms such as light, temperature, pH, etc.</em>

#### Light intensity
- Affects the growth of plants and animals
- Green plants (with chlorophyll) exist only where there is a sufficient amount of light required to undergo photosynthesis
- Many animals require light to see, hunt, and detect potential dangers, such as predators. On the other hand, some animals are adapted to live in conditions with little or no light.

#### Temperature
- Affects the rate of metabolism in plants and animals
- Most organisms cannot tolerate extreme temperatures (too high or too low)
- Plants are able to survive through seasons such as summer and winter by:
  1. storing good in underground storage organs
  2. shedding leaves to reduce water loss
  3. producing seeds which are resistant to extreme temperatures
- Some animals are adapted physically (e.g. blubber in bears) and/or behaviourally (e.g. hibernation) to survive extreme temperatures

#### Water Availability
- Affects the population size and location of plants and animals
- No living organism can survive without water
- Some animals (e.g. camels) and plants (e.g. cacti) are adapted to survive in areas with limited water supply.
  - Plants adapted to survive with little water may show some of these adaptations:
    1. young leaves are shed or are reduced to spines so as to lower the rate of transpiration
    2. fleshy stems store up water
    3. green stems take over the function of photosynthesis from leaves
- Some animals (e.g. fishes) and plants (e.g. hydrilla) are adapted to survive in aquatic environments.

#### Oxygen Content
- Most organisms require oxygen to survive
- They cannot survive in environments with low oxygen content, unless they have special adaptations to obtain sufficient oxygen

#### Salinity
- Aquatic organisms are affected by the concentration of salt in the water due to the difference in water potential between their cells and the aquatic environment
- For example, freshwater organisms tend to have excess water entering the body cells by osmosis. Some adaptions to prevent rupturing of cells include having rigid cell walls in plants and contractile vacuooles in unicellular organisms such as the <em>paramecium</em>

#### pH
- Acidity or alkalinity of soil water or aquatic habitats influences the types of organisms that can live in that environment
- Aquatic organisms are sensitive to pH of the water. They may die if there is a drastic or sudden change in pH

Abiotic factors can influence a species' ability to survive. Every species is able to survive within a range of each of these factors called the <b><u>species' tolerance range</u></b>.

- Tolerance range is the range within which a species can exist (high + low population).
- The optimal range is the range within which a speicies is best adapted. It thrives with a high population.
- Near the upper and lower limits of the tolerance range, individuals experience stress.
- This will reduce the species'
  1. health
  2. rate of growth
  3. reproduction


## The Biotic Environment

<em>Biotic factors are living components of the ecosystem, which include all the living organisms that influence other organisms such as predator and prey.</em>

Each species of organism has a unique and specific role to play within the ecosystem and this role is referred to as its <b>niche</b>. It includes what the organism feeds, how it obtains its food, who preys on it, how it reproduces, etc.

Each species has a niche that differs in certain ways from the niches of the other species in the same ecosystem. No two species will have identical niches within the same ecosystem.

An organism cannot survive on its own. Living organisms evolved to have different relationships between each other. These <b>interrelationships</b> help to <b>keep the balance in an ecosystem</b>.

#### Symbiotic Relationships

The type of interaction between organisms depends on wheterh one benefits, loses or gains nothing from the relationship. Some interactions in a community include:

- Predation
  - a carnivorous/omnivorous organism (predator) feeds on another organism (prey) 
  - e.g. a tiger feeds on a deer
- Parasitism 
  - one species (a parasite) lives at the expense of another species (the host)
  - e.g. a tapeworm living in vertebrate hosts
- Mutualism 
  - two species living together where both species benefit from the relationship
  - e.g. sea anemones and clownfish.
- Commensalism
  - two species living together where one species benefits but the other is neither farmed nor benefits
  - e.g. barnacles living on whales
