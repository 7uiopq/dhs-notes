## The Hydrological Cycle (Where Water Comes From):
1. Evaporation and Transpiration
   - Water from water bodies like rivers and seas turn into water vapour due to evaporation from the sun's heat.
   - Plants also give out water vapour from their lives.
   
2. Condensation
   - Water vapour cools and becomes water droplets, forming clouds.
   
3. Precipitation
   - Clouds becoming heavier as more water droplets gather, allowing rain to occur and letting water fall back to Earth's surface.
   
 4. Infiltration
    - Some water from the rain seeps into the soil and infiltrates deep into the underlying rock layers. The water held under the ground is known as groundwater.
    
 5. Surface runoff
    - The unabsorbed water flows over the Earth's surface, down hills and mountains into rivers, lakes, and eventually seas, where it will evaporate once again.

#### World Water Use
World average:
- 70% agricultural usage
- 22% industrial usage
- 8% domestic

Low and Middle Income countries:
- 82% agricultural usage
- 10% industrial usage
- 8% domestic usage

High Income countries:
- 59% industrial usage
- 30% agricultural usage
- 11% domestic usage

**Water use per capita** is the average amount of water used per person in a fixed amount of time.

America's water use per capita = 156 gallons/day
France's water use per capita = 77 gallons/day
India's water use per capita = 38 gallons/day
Mali's water use per capita = 3 gallons/day

**Water footprint** is the total average volume of water used to produce the goods and services for a person in a year.

Direct water footprint - water used directly by the individual
Indirect water footprint - summation of water footprints of all the products consumed

**Water shortage** occurs when the water demand usages exceeds the water supply.

**Water security** is the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods and production.

**Water scarcity** is the lack of water supply to meet the water usage.

Water security - 2500m3> water supply annually <br>
Water vulnerability - 1701-2500m3 water supply annually <br>
Water stress - 1001-1700m3 water supply annually <br>
Water security - 1000m3< water supply annually <br>

Countries with water security include Canada, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand.
Countries facing water scarcity include Egypt and Algeria.

## Causes of Water Shortage
Demand factors:
- Population growth
  - The world population grew from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 3.1 billion in 1960.
  - As world population grows at an increasing rate, so does the need for water.

- Affluence
  - Being affluent means having more wealth and being able to live more comfortably.
  - With more money, people start to consume goods that are produced using more water and live a lifestyle that consumes more water.
    - Water can be used for ornamental and leisure purposes, like fountains and swimming pools. Most of this water is lost via evaporation or leakage.
    - Millions of people worldwide will also change their water source from wells to piped water, increasing the usage of water.
    - More goods like clothing, which needs thousands of litres of water to be produced, will be purchased. For example, one cotton T-shirt requires 400 litres of water to be produced.
    - More water-intensive appliances like dishwashers and washing machines are also being implemented in millions of homes worldwide.
    - People are able to afford more expensive and water-intensive foods such as meat.
    
Supply factors:
- Seasonal rainfall
  - Uneven rainfall and low precipitation during a period of a few months can lead to a decrease in the supply of water.
  - For example, although India has a high annual precipitation of more than 1,200 millimetres, its rainfall is unevenly distributed throughout the year. Most of the rainfall is collected from May to August, while the rest of the year is dry.
  - Climate change is also linked to irregular distribution of rainfall throughout the year.
  
- Water pollution
  - Oil, grease, litter, soap from houses, along with fertilisers, pesticides, and dirty water from farms and factories are washed down into rivers and seas, leading to a drop in the water quality.
  - For example, pollution in the Ganges River, the largest river in India, has led to villages near the river to face water scarcity.
  
## Impacts of Water Shortage
Domestic Impacts:
- Increased difficulty in collecting water
   - Due to droughts and dry weather conditions, many wells and ponds have dried up. As a result, people have to travel to further places to obtain clean water.
   - For example, women in parts of Asia and Africa, like India, have to walk 6 kilometres daily to collect water. Moreover, the water collected may be dirty and contain water-borne diseases such as cholera.
   
- Water rationing
  - Water rationing is the act of making water available only at certain times of the day. This results in people having to wake up early or stay up late in order to collect water for their use.
  - For example, during the 1960s, Singapore suffered a severe drought which caused water levels in the reservoirs to be dangerously low. To conserve the water supply, the government imposed water rationing, thus affecting every household in Singapore.
  
Economic Impacts:
- Reduced agricultural yields
   - When water supply decreases, crop yield drops, resulting in less food produced and people dying due to starvation.
   - For example, in Punjab, India, groundwater stocks are becoming depleted at a rate faster than they can be replenished. This has resulted in farmers' agricultural yields being decreased at a steady rate.
 
- Increased cost of industrial production
   - The cost of industrial production refers to the cost of producing and manufacturing goods.
   - As water constraints increase, so will the cost of industrial production.
   - For example, in Europe and America, due to warm and dry summers in 2003, 2006 and 2009, some power plants reduced their power output as there was a lack of water to cool the generators. 
   
Political impact:
- Conflict over water supply
   - Conflicts can arise over water resources when there is not enough water to go around.
   - On a national scale, problems may arise when states or countries tap into the same water source.
   - For example, the Mekong River winds its way nearly 4,500 kilometres through six countries. From its source on the Tibetan Plateau, the river meanders through China, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam before reaching the sea.
     - Conflicts arise among some of the countries that share the Mekong. For example, Lao PDR's proposal to build the Xayaburi dam has gotten strong objections from neighbouring countries.
     
## Water shortage solutions
Reducing water consumption:
- Pricing of water
   - Water is priced to reflect the scarcity of water and also to cover the high cost of producing clean water. 
   - The Water Conversation Tax is a pricing system where an additional amount of money is charged based on total water consumption.
   - This pricing system encourages people to reduce their water consumption to reduce their tax rates.

- Public education
   - This helps consumers to make informed choices when purchasing household products such as washing machines. It also helps the public to be more aware of reducing water consumption by using more water-efficient products.
   
Increasing water supply:
- Local water catchment areas
   - Water catchment areas refer to the area over which rain falls and is collected. 
   - Local catchment areas take advantage of Singapore's high rainfall.
   - Local catchment areas can also be recreational places
   - However, land used for local catchment implies less land is available for other uses such as housing and industry.
   - When there is little rainfall or a drought, local catchment areas are ineffective.
   
- Imported water
   - Pipelines were built to transport water from Johor to Singapore due to the water agreement that Malaysia signed with Singapore.
   - Importing water does not require land and hence frees up the land for other uses.
   - Imported water is a cheaper source of water compared to desalinated water or NEWater.
   - However, one disadvantage is that imported water may not be enough to meet water demands.
   - Furthermore, water agreements eventually expire and there are no guarantees of future agreements.
   
- NEWater
   - Used water may be treated to become drinking water.
   - An advantage of NEWater is that it is not dependent on rainfall because it is produced from used water.
   - Moreover, NEWater is ultra-pure and of high quality, purer than tap water, meaning that it is ideal for use in certain industries.
   - However, NEWater is extremely expensive to produce.
   - The public may find it difficult to fully accept this new technology of obtaining water from used water due to lack of knowledge about the treatment process.
   
- Desalination
   - Desalination refers to the process of removing dissolved salts and other minerals from seawater in order to make it pure drinking water.
   - Like NEWater, desalinated water is independent of rainfall and can be used to supplement water supply during a long dry spell.
   - Desalination is attractive since we are in an island surrounded by a limitless supply of seawater.
   - But, desalinated water is very expensive to produce as its production is energy-intensive.
   - Large amounts of chemicals and salt solutions are produced during the desalination process. If they are improperly disposed if into the oceans, it may result in pollution.
