## The Hydrological Cycle (Where Water Comes From):
1. Evaporation and Transpiration
   - Water from water bodies like rivers and seas turn into water vapour due to evaporation from the sun's heat.
   - Plants also give out water vapour from their lives.
   
2. Condensation
   - Water vapour cools and becomes water droplets, forming clouds.
   
3. Precipitation
   - Clouds becoming heavier as more water droplets gather, allowing rain to occur and letting water fall back to Earth's surface.
   
 4. Infiltration
    - Some water from the rain seeps into the soil and infiltrates deep into the underlying rock layers. The water held under the ground is known as groundwater.
    
 5. Surface runoff
    - The unabsorbed water flows over the Earth's surface, down hills and mountains into rivers, lakes, and eventually seas, where it will evaporate once again.
    
## Common uses of water
Domestic:
- Activities that use water in and around the house.
- Drinking and cooking
- Hygiene
  - Bathing
  - Hand-washing
- Amenity uses
  - Car washing
  - Gardening purposes
  
Agricultural:
- Growing and watering crops
- Powering agricultural tools
- Irrigation
- Used in pesticides and fertilisers
- Keeping livestock
  - Approximately 3,100,000 litres of water are needed to produce 200kg of boneless beef
    - 1300kg of grains (wheats, oats, etc.)
    - 7200kg of roughages
    - 24000 liters for drinking
    - 7000 liters for servicing
    
Industrial
- Generating electricity
  - Generators in power plants powered by steam
  - Hydropower and nuclear power generation
  - Thermal power generation
- Pharmaceutical purposes
  - Used as an ingredient in various formulations
  - Cleaning agent
 
#### World Water Use
World average:
- 70% agricultural usage
- 22% industrial usage
- 8% domestic

Low and Middle Income countries:
- 82% agricultural usage
- 10% industrial usage
- 8% domestic usage

High Income countries:
- 59% industrial usage
- 30% agricultural usage
- 11% domestic usage

**Water use per capita** is the average amount of water used per person in a fixed amount of time.

America's water use per capita = 156 gallons/day
France's water use per capita = 77 gallons/day
India's water use per capita = 38 gallons/day
Mali's water use per capita = 3 gallons/day

**Water footprint** is the total average volume of water used to produce the goods and services for a person in a year.

Direct water footprint - water used directly by the individual
Indirect water footprint - summation of water footprints of all the products consumed

**Water shortage** occurs when the water demand usages exceeds the water supply.

**Water security** is the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods and production.

**Water scarcity** is the lack of water supply to meet the water usage.

Water security - 2500m3> water supply annually
Water vulnerability - 1701-2500m3 water supply annually
Water stress - 1001-1700m3 water supply annually
Water security - 1000m3< water supply annually

Countries with water security include Canada, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand.
Countries facing water scarcity include Egypt and Algeria.
